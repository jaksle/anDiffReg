# anDiffReg
Regression methods for analysing TA-MSD described in the paper J. Ślęzak, J. Janczura, D. Krapf and R. Metzler "Improved mean squared displacement analysis for
anomalous single particle trajectories" implemented in Julia and Python. Julia version is the basis, Python is a translation.

All the necessary functions are in `anDiffReg` .jl or .py files. Check `exemplaryAnalysis` scripts to see how to perform exemplary TA-MSD analysis.
